# Bitwise operations
These are pixel level operations that uses Masks to target a specific part of an image, using binary logic (AND, OR, XOR, NOT). Mask is a certain region that we define that consists of binary numbers of 0s and 1s, aka RIO - region of interest. Where 0 is the part we are not interested in and 1 is our interest


| Operation | Logic | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AND** | `Both must be white` | Only the area where the square and ellipse **overlap** remains. |
| **OR** | `Either can be white` | Both shapes are combined into one large white area. |
| **XOR** | `Only one is white` | Keeps both shapes, but the area where they overlap turns **black**. |
| **NOT** | `Invert` | Turns the white square into a black square with a white background. |


alpha: contrast factor; values > 1 increase contrast, values < 1 decrease contrast.

beta: brightness offset; adding a positive number brightens the image, while a negative number darkens it.

cv2.convertScaleAbs(): applies the linear transformation

Formula to apply linear transformation: new_image = alpha*image + beta

# Gamma correction for brightening and contrast
More natural way of changing brightness and contrast of an image. We gamma < 1, mid tones become darker, when gamma > 1, mid tones become brigther, when gamma = 0, no chnages.


The formula is a Power Law:
$$O = \left( \frac{I}{255} \right)^\gamma \times 255$$
Normalize: Divide the pixel value ($I$) by 255 to get a range from 0 to 1.
The Curve: Raise that number to the power of $\gamma$.
Denormalize: Multiply back by 255 to get your final pixel ($O$).
